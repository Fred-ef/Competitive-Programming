## Problem

Given a sequence of integers, find the subsequence with the maximum sum and return it.

## Solution

The proposed solution is implemented in Rust. The `max_sub_array` function takes a vector of integers `nums` as input and returns the maximum sum of a subsequence within this vector.

The code uses an approach based on Kadane's algorithm to find the subsequence with the maximum sum. Here's how it works:

1. We initialize two variables, `max` and `sum`, both set to `nums[0`, which represents the first element of the vector.

2. We iterate through the vector starting from the second element onwards.

3. For each element `num` in the vector, we check if the current sum `sum` is greater than zero. If it is, we add `num` to `sum`. Otherwise, we assign `num` to `sum`. This step keeps track of the sum of the current subsequence.

4. In each iteration, we check if `sum` is greater than `max`. If it is, we update `max` with the value of `sum`. This allows us to find the maximum sum encountered so far.

5. At the end of the loop, `max` will contain the maximum sum of the subsequence.

## Usage Example

```rust
use project_name::max_sub_array;

fn main() {
    let test_array = vec![2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3];
    let result = max_sub_array(test_array);
    println!("Maximum sum of the subsequence: {}", result);
}
